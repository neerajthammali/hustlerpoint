Every successful startup begins with an idea, and for many, that idea starts as a side hustle. Juggling a full-time job while building a business is demanding, but it's also a low-risk way to validate your concept. But what happens when your side project gains traction? How do you know when it's time to make the leap?

It's not just about one good month; you need to see a predictable pattern of growth. Beyond financials, consider demand. Are you turning away customers because you don't have enough time?

Before you quit your day job, make sure you have a solid business plan. Understand your target market, your operational needs, and have a clear strategy for growth. It's a daunting step, but with careful planning, your side hustle can become the main event.
